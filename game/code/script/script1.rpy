        i"Listen John, and listen carefully!"
        j"Gotcha."
        i"Basically here is where we are in the grid. Our home location, (192,168)!"
        "The Grid cyberspace huh.. So it follows a cartesian plane system."
        j"It's so empty.. what do we even do in here?"
        i"Lots of things. But I'm not going to spoil!"
        j"What?"
        i"You're gonna have to come with me!"
        j"O-kay.."
        i"So let me give you a tutorial."
        j"I get it. Arrow keys for movement, 'Z' for action, probably triggers stuff like, talking to NPCs and getting items, right?"
        $ ILY_m = 'O'
        i"How did you know?!"
        j"Humans are an intelligent species."
        $ ILY_m = 'smile3'
        i"Well, in addition to that, You can talk to me anytime by pressing 'X'."
        j"Okay."
        
        j"There's one thing I am curious about since this crossroad area resembles the one we have IRL."
        i"IRL?"
        j"Could it be that we can find a path to SDS using this GRID?"
        i"You mean using its geological location?"
        j"Yes. to the west of here, approaching Connecht Square, we can get to my internship office."
        i"There's one way to find out!"
        j"Alright, let's explore the area then."
